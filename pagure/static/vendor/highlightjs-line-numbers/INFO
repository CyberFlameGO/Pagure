This is a slightly patched version of the Highlightjs-line-numbers plugin from
https://github.com/wcoder/highlightjs-line-numbers.js

It adds some additional classes and links on the line numbers to get some stuff
in Pagure working.

This was patched over this version of the upstream file:
https://github.com/wcoder/highlightjs-line-numbers.js/blob/35dcbb3e23ef6ee185b816f3af09265a0d561f54/dist/highlightjs-line-numbers.min.js
