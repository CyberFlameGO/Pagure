This is a slightly patched version of the Highlightjs-line-numbers plugin from
https://github.com/wcoder/highlightjs-line-numbers.js

Downstream repo: https://pagure.io/pagure-highlightjs-line-numbers.js

It adds some additional classes and links on the line numbers to get some stuff
in Pagure working.

This file version comes from this commit: https://pagure.io/pagure-highlightjs-line-numbers.js/tree/a8a95ff2384d9f03d8aa832e793ce0af464329ff
