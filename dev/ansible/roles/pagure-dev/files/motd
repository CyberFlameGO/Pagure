Welcome to the Pagure development environment!

Here are some tips:

* Pagure is installed in a Python virtualenv. Use `deactivate` to leave it,
  or `workon python2-pagure` to get back in.

* The code for Pagure is located at ~/devel/

* You can populate the database with `python dev-data.py --all`

* Run `pstart` to start the development server and `pstop` to stop it.

* Logs for the server are available with `journalctl`; the services are run
  as systemd user units in ~/.config/systemd/user/

Once you start the server you can navigate to http://localhost:5000/
in your browser on the host to access your Pagure development environment.

Happy hacking!
