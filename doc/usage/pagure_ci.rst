Pagure CI
=========

Pagure CI is a service integrating the results of Continuous Integration (CI)
services, such as jenkins or travis-ci, into pull-requests opened against
your project on pagure.


.. note:: By default pagure-ci is off, an admin of your pagure instance will
    need to configure it to support one or more CI services. Check the
    configuration section on how to do that.
